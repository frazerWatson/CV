# Frazer Watson

Tyrannical self discipline and dedication is how I learn anything. I was fascinated by code as soon as I was introduced to it and began to teach myself from books and online resources, before deciding to join Makers Academy and dedicate everyday for four long months working to develop my knowledge and skill as a junior developer. I love coding and it is what I want to do to earn a living.

- Problem solver and adept at analysing situations as they are happening in real time. 
- Tenacious hunter and exterminator of bugs. 
- Dedicate myself to the things I do completely. 
- Work well in a team and support co-workers.

###Oxford Brookes University/Staffordshire University

- Studied three years of philosophy. Which is my ultimate area of study, but dropped out in my final semester.
I still carry on my own education in philosophy and consider reading a serious endeavour rather than a pastime. I am particularly interested in logic, economics, theories of motivation and ancient Cynicism.

## Future Development

I'm interested in learning and working with new technologies:

- iOS development
- Swift
- Objective C
- Java
- Php
