# Frazer Watson

A CS friend of mine sat me down and showed me how they see a computer, until that moment I had no idea what code was.
It was fascinating, the intricacy involved, breaking issues down into minute processes in order to solve bigger problems. I needed to know more. I needed to understand what this stuff was and what it could do. So I began to teach myself from books and online resources. Learning was challenging, and putting all my effort and time into trying to become a junior developer has been a difficult test, but it was a very important decision for me and I was determined. I have earned my current knowledge and skill through hard work and dedication, and now my main concern is to continue to progress and develop my skill and experience to the highest degree possible. This is what I want to do to earn a living.

## Skills

- Agile development and TDD principlces for all my projects. Used to working in a team, using Github and dev workflow, and have a lot of experience with pairing.

- Worked with Ruby building basic programs and Sinatra web apps, where I familiarised myself with PostgeSQL, API's such as Twilio.

- Moving into Rails, I started building more complex and interactive products, such as a [Rails clone of AirBnb](https://github.com/frazerWatson/MakersBnbRails), and recently built an app called [RoadTripper](https://github.com/frazerWatson/road_tripper), designed to help people plan and share their road trip adventures, utilising AWS(S3) and Google maps, Geolocator and Places API's, with a Bootstrap frontend. I am also familiar with gems and API's such as DataMapper, Paperclip and Devise

- I have also worked with [AngularJS](https://github.com/frazerWatson/github_clone), Javascript, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS.

- XP and software craftsmanship.
